                            Each embellishment job for uniforms is unique, so it depends upon what you want embellished and the fabric.  Sometimes we will recommend several options, to reduce the cost or make a project more efficient or improve on a design idea.  You can always send us a message or call us to discuss with a live person.

                            We can translate logos or designs that you provide into a rhinestone pattern, however, we do not design logos from scratch (you need a designer to do that).  Embellishment of uniforms can include logos and patterns or highlighting of specific parts of a garment. If you need to talk to a human, feel free to call us at 310-539-6000.

                            Embellishment of uniforms can vary widely in time and labor, so it is impossible to generalize without specific information.  There are some jobs that can be done within a few days and some that can take several weeks to complete. Since we are located in the United States, we do not have extended overseas shipping times.

                            For wholesale orders, we get shipping quotes based on the weight and size dimensions of the package.   We can estimate your shipping costs, but the exact shipping price will be calculated once we have your order complete and get an exact weight.

                            For wholesale orders, including embellishment of uniforms, the production of the order is dependent upon order quantity and complexity of the application.  Each order is different, once we see what you need, we can provide a firm estimate of timing.
