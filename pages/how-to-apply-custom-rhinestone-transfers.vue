<h2 class="">Three Ingredients of Flawless Application</h2>

	<h4>Application Recipe</h4>
	<ul class="li-none">
	<li>Time:<span>15 seconds</span></li>

	<h3 class="text-jlav">Temperature</h3>
	<p>The correct temperature is the most important ingredient for application of heat rhinestone transfers to a garment.  Heat presses allow the user to set a specific temperature, but it is important to check the heating element for consistency and to ensure it is reaching the temperature on the display.  We recommend checking temperature daily.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3 class="text-jlav">Time</h3>
	<p>The amount of time that a garment is under the heat press is a balancing act.  Too long and the garment can get scorched, too short and the rhinestones will not heat to temperature and adhere to the garment.  The proper timing of a press is also based on the fabric.  Heat-sensitive fabrics, like synthetic fibers and light or white garments need to be pressed for the minimum time possible.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3 class="text-jlav">Pressure</h3>
	<p>Correct pressure settings are the most common reason for poor application of a heat transfer.  Sufficient pressure ensures that the heat elements deliver the heat to the glue on the back of the stone and presses the glue to enter the fibers of the garment. </p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="">Application Equipment</h2>

<h5 class="text-jlav text-left my-0">Poor</h5>
<h4 class="text-left my-0">Iron</h4>
<p class="box-flex-two"><img class="" src="/image/equipment-iron.png" /></p>
<p>While it is possible to apply customs rhinestone transfers with a standard iron, it often leads to poor results.  Since the iron does not cover the full transfer, it is necessary to move the iron across the design. This will tend to result in big differences in the time and pressure that is applied across the area of the transfer. </p>

<li class="w-full md:w-1/3">
<h5 class="text-jlav text-left my-0">Good</h5>
<h4 class="text-left my-0">Heat Press</h4>
<p class="box-flex-two"><img class="" src="/image/equipment-heat-press.png" /></p>
<p>Heat presses are the standard method of applying custom rhinestone transfers to a garment.  A heat press consists of an upper heated surface and a lower platen that the garment rests upon.  Most heat presses are manually operated, or semi-manual and allow the user to set a specific temperature and increase or decrease pressure settings, although the pressure setting is not a precise as an automatic heat press.</p>
</li>
<li class="w-full md:w-1/3">
<h5 class="text-jlav text-left my-0">Excellent</h5>
<h4 class="text-left my-0">Automated Heat Press</h4>
<p class="box-flex-two"><img class="" src="/image/equipment-auto-heat-press.png" /></p>
<p>The most consistent method of pressing heat transfers or any type is with an automatic heat press, which uses compressed air pressure to lower the heat platen on the garment and provide a specific amount of pressure. Unfortunately, automatic heat presses are costly and an experienced user can achieve the same results with a manual or semi-manual heat press.</p>
