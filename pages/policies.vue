<h4 class="text-left">Quality Guarantee</h4>

<p>All of our products are quality guaranteed. It is very rare for crystals to come loose from the shirts. If this does happen, we will be happy to replace or repair any defects from normal wear. We recommend that the shirt be turned inside out before washing (hand or machine), using cold water (no bleach) and low heat in the dryer - this will insure they look their best for a long time! Please do not dry clean</p>

<h4 class="text-left">Return Policy</h4>

<p>If the product is custom or personalized with a name or other unique content, we cannot accept merchandise returns. Due to our wide selection of crystal and shirt colors and styles, each of our crystal rhinestone products is specially made-to-order per your specifications. For custom and personalized products, we cannot accept merchandise returns. For non-custom items, there is a $10.00 re-stocking fee per time for all merchandise returns. There is a maximum of 2 item exchanges per order. All returned merchandise must be unworn and in re-saleable condition to qualify for a return. All requests for returns or exchanges must be made within 7 days from receipt of the products. Due to hygiene issues, bikini bottoms are not returnable. Return shipping charges are not reimburseable.</p>
