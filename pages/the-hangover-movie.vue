<p class="pt-6">"The Hangover", a major 2009 hit from Warner Bros. Pictures, is regarded by Hollywood critics as a sparkling comedy gem and a little bit of that sparkle was provided by JustJen.com's fun and flirtatious rhinestone bridesmaid shirts.</p>

<p>JustJen.com's rhinestone bridesmaid T-shirts made their big Hollywood debut in one particularly iconic scene, where the bride (Sasha Barrese) is on the phone with groomsman Phil (Bradley Cooper).

<p>Now it seems Hollywood has given Just Jen a starring role in a major motion picture.</p>

<p>"When producers contacted us, we were all so excited," said founder Jennifer Smith. "It must have been a last-minute wardrobe decision, because we had to rush them out by Fedex Overnight."</p>

<p>It's certainly a cinematic moment that has the JustJen crew excited about where their rhinestone fashions will end up next.</p>
