<p class="pt-6">The "Today" show is one of the biggest morning shows in the nation and now JustJen.com has reached an audience of millions thanks to two separate appearances within the space of two years.</p>

<p>It seems that not only are brides and fashionistas fans of JustJen.com, but also TV executives. Founder Jennifer Smith fielded not only one, but two separate requests to have the unique rhinestone fashions of JustJen.com featured on "Today".</p>"I was so pleased to accept the generous offers of the "Today" show," says Smith. "It provided JustJen.com with the perfect opportunity to show America why we're regarded as the ultimate provider of fun and flirty custom rhinestone clothing.

<p>"Of course, it doesn't hurt that it's one of my favorite TV shows," she adds with a laugh.</p>

<p>The first appearance occurred during the Christmas episode on a segment regarding special holiday gifts. The segment, which was hosted by gift-giving guru Robyn Spizman, revealed Just Jen's beautiful rhinestone Christmas T-shirts in front of an audience of millions.</p>

<p>The second appearance was made just prior to Valentine's Day, where Just Jen's personalized Valentine's shirts and lingerie were a major highlight of the show.</p>
