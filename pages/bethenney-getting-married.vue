  <p>Bethenny Frankel, the star of Bethenny Getting Married, created a paparazzi frenzy as she shows off her dazzling bridal style with a Just Jen rhinestone "Bride" sweat suit, and brides across the country emulate her fashion statement on their wedding day.</p>
</div>
    <p class="pt-6">Bethenny Frankel, entrepreneur and star of Bravo's Hit TV show, "Bethenny Getting Married?", created a paparazzi feeding frenzy when she arrived at The Four Seasons Hotel in New York City wearing a dazzling rhinestone bridal sweat suit, purchased from JustJen.com. The bridal sweat suit was one of the memorable fashion moments of an episode of "Bethenny Getting Married?", which originally aired on Bravo in June 2010, and subsequently re-ran throughout July and August and in 2012.</p>
    <p>Jennifer Smith, Just Jen's founder and CEO, said, "I was called by a customer who told me that she had seen Bethenny Frankel from "The Real Housewives of New York City" wearing our <NuxtLink title="bride sweatsuit" to="/bridal-hoodies">bride sweat suit.</NuxtLink> I did a quick search of our orders and, sure enough, Bethenny's order was placed in March, right before her wedding. It took a little while, but we soon realized the hoodie was worn on Bravo's "Bethenny Getting Married?", not "The Real Housewives of New York City<em>".</em></p>

    <p>Bethenny wore the bride hoodie on the "Let Me Eat Cake" episode, which covered her day leading up to the wedding ceremony. The Hoodie that she wore was the 3 row Bride Hoodie, which has three rows of crystals for extra bling. She selected the white velour hoodie, with red rhinestones.</p>
    <p>The paparazzi went into a frenzy as Bethenny stepped onto the sidewalk in front of the Plaza Hotel in New York, where the wedding was being held. The photographers' flash bulbs bounced off the sparkling rhinestones with the glittering bride message.</p>
    <p>Ever since the hoodie was worn on the show, sales of wedding sweat suits at JustJen.com have risen dramatically! "We get lots of calls from brides and mothers of brides who saw the hoodie on Bethenny and then went online to search for it. Luckily, we are pretty easy to find through Google", Smith said.</p>
